## Summary

In 2009, Munz et al. [1] have written a pedagogical paper that helps to understand how to solve systems of coupled differential equations. it dealt with the simulation of zombie infection among the human population. The model is here implemented in Matlab using a slightly different approach than by [1].

## Content

The present repository is made of:
- one example file
- one zombies.m function that implements (partly) the model proposed by Munz et al.
- one erad.m function that is based on the "impulsive eradication" model.
