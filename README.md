In 2009, Munz et al. [1] have written a pedagogical paper that helps to understand how to solve systems of coupled differential equations. it dealt with the simulation of zombie infection among the human population. The model they use is here implemented in Matlab.


The present repository is made of:
- one example file
- one zombies.m function that implements (partly) the model proposed by Munz et al.
- one erad.m function that is based on the "impulsive eradication" model.
